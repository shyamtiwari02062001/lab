            The black-shouldered kite (Elanus axillaris) is a small raptor found in open habitat throughout Australia. It resembles similar species found in Africa, Eurasia and North America, including the black-winged kite. Measuring around 35 cm (14 in) in length with a wingspan of 80 to 100 cm (30 to 40 in), the adult has predominantly grey and white plumage, prominent black markings above its red eyes, and black patches on its wings. Monogamous pairs engage in aerial courtship displays and breed between August and January. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around 30 days. Chicks are fully fledged within five weeks of hatching and can hunt for mice within a week of leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the home territory. The black-shouldered kite hunts in open fields and grasslands, searching for its prey while hovering. It mainly eats small rodents, particularly the introduced house mouse. The species is not threatened. (Full article...)

Measuring around 35 cm (14 in) in length with a wingspan of 80 to 100 cm (30 to 40 in), the adult has predominantly grey and white plumage, prominent black markings above its red eyes, and black patches on its wings. Monogamous pairs engage in aerial courtship displays and breed between August and January. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around 30 days. Chicks are fully fledged within five weeks of hatching and can hunt for mice within a week of leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the home territory. The black-shouldered kite hunts in open fields and grasslands, searching for its prey while hovering. It mainly eats small rodents, particularly the introduced house mouse. The species is not threatened. (Full article...)
